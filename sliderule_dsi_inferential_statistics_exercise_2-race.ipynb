    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "Racial discrimination continues to be a very real problem in the United States and around the world. A recent study looked at whether the perceived race of an applicant had an impact on the callback rate for a job application. Resumes were randomly assigned black-sounding or white-sounding names and researchers observed whether or not the difference had an impact on employer requests for interviews. Black-sounding names received requests for interviews 6.5% of the time, while white-sounding names received interview requests 9.7% of the time. We wanted to determine whether the difference between the groups was statistically significant, or whether it was a random result. To make this determination, we used a two-sample t-test. Our analysis shows that the perceived race of a candidate has an effect on the callback success rate.\n"

    "No, our analysis does not mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success. While the race (or perceived race from the name) does have an effect on callback success, there are other important factors employers take into consideration. For example, we do not know how researchers controlled for education and experience. Were identical resumes given two different names? Or did the resumes have a range of education and experience? To amend my analysis, I would look more into the resumes and how the education, experience, and location compared between the white-sounding name resumes and black-sounding name resumes."
